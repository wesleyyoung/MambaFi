# MambaFi

If you have ever worked in commercial or residential IT, you'll know that Wi-Fi passwords can be a pain to manage. There isn't a good way to manage them for teams or personal use, meaning it can become an unecessary roadblock during service calls. MambaFi lets you view, explore, delete, import, and export your repository of Wi-Fi profiles so that you can easily distribute them to new computers and team members

# Open Source

Made with Node.js, Electron, and Angular 8

# Clean Design

Crafted using the Material Design library. Not all Windows desktop apps have to look like PuTTY

# Built For Speed

Export all of your known Wi-Fi connections and load them onto another computer, without ever opening up a command prompt
